We will expand on the code from previous example, and add a bit more data to our account creation. We will also
store the accounts in an array.

First, we will add a new enum - `AccountType` with two values: `DEBIT` and `CREDIT`.
We will ask for the account type from the user in addition to the data we've asked for earlier.

Then we will store the account in an array and ask the user for another account. After this one is also stored in the 
array, we will use the index notation (`result[0]`) to display the values. Don't worry about the repetition, we will 
optimize that code in next exercises!

The `index.ts` file already contains some empty methods with comments on what needs to be implemented. Please follow those instructions, 
and run `npm run start` to test the solution.

Happy coding!
