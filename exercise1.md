`hello-world.ts` is the `typescript` file.


In order to compile it to `javascript`, you need to:
- Install node from [Node downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Install typescript using `npm -g typescript`
- Run `tsc hello-world.ts`


This should result in creation of `hello-world.js` file.
To test if the code runs correctly, execute `node hello-world.js` and look for the appropriate message in the console.
